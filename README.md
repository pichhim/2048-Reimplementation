# 2048-Reimplementation
This repository consists of an implementation of 2048 in JavaScript to gain practice with interactive webpages using jQuery and event handlers.

# Setup Instructions
- Install dependencies: 'npm install bulma jquery keypress browser-sync'

# Two Ways To Play:
1) Run the "console" script in package.json to run the application in a text-based form in the terminal
2) Run 'browser-sync -sw' to locally launch the webpage on your localhost (*recommended*)

Have fun!
